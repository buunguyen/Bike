h1. Interpreted language built on .NET/Mono

* Dynamic and strong typing
* Everything is an (expando) object
* Prototypal inheritance
* First-class functions
* CLR interoperability
* Cross-platform (Windows, OSX, Linux)

h1. Run Bike

I don't update the Mac OSX and Windows installers frequently, except for major releases. So to access latest features, you should follow these steps: 

* Fork or download code
* Build (with @VS.NET@ or @MonoDevelop@, if you're on Mac OSX)
* If you use Windows, run <pre>@[code_folder]/src/Bike.Console/bin/Debug/bike.exe" -h="[code_folder]" bike_file.bk@</pre>
* If you use Mac OSX, run <pre>@/usr/bin/mono "[code_folder]/src/Bike.Console/bin/Debug/bike.exe" -h="[code_folder]" bike_file.bk@</pre>

bq. Notes:
- You should configure NotePad&#43;&#43;, TextMate or whatever code editor to run @bike@ based on the above commands
- NotePad++ users can use this "file":https://github.com/buunguyen/Bike/blob/master/resources/np.xml to enable syntax highlighting (View > User-Defined Dialog > Import)


h1. Install Bike on Mac OSX

* Prerequisite: Mono 2.10.2+
* Download @bike.pkg@ in @installers/osx@
* Run @bike.pkg@ to install Bike
* Open the Terminal and type the followings <pre>@cat > hello.bk
println('Hello World');
Ctrl-D
bike.sh hello.bk@</pre>

bq. Notes:
- If you didn't install Mono or Bike to their default folders, modify @/usr/local/bin/bike.sh@ to use correct paths
- If you want to double-click to execute a Bike file in @Finder@, associate the @.bk@ extension to @Applications/bike/bin/bike.app@


h1. Install Bike on Windows

* Prerequisite: .NET 4+
* Download @bike.exe@ in @installers/win@
* Run @bike.exe@ to extract and install Bike
* Create a file named @hello.bk@ with this content <pre>@println('Hello World');@</pre>
* In the cmd, type @bike hello.bk@ to execute it. Alternatively, you can double-click a Bike file in Windows Explorer.

bq. The setup program also makes the following changes to your system:
- @BIKE_HOME@ env variable pointing to the installation folder
- Append @[installation_folder]bin/@ to @PATH@ env variable
- Associate @.bk@ extension with @bike.exe@


h1. Examples

h3. Fibonacci

bc. func fib( n ) {
    n <= 2 ? n: fib( n - 1 ) + fib( n - 2 )
}
print( "n: " );
var n = readln();
println( fib( n.to_number() ) );
read();

h3. Curry

bc. Bike.Function.curry = func( *args ) {
	if ( args == null || args.size() == 0 ) return this;
	var me = this;
	return func( *more ) {
		if ( more != null )  
			args.add_all( more );
		me.call( this, *args );
	};
};
func add( a, b ) { a + b }
var addTo2 = add.curry( 2 );
println( addTo2( 3 ) );


h1. What's next?

* Want to learn more about Bike?  Take a look at sample code in "samples":https://github.com/buunguyen/Bike/tree/master/samples.  The file @spec.bk@ should give you a good overview.
* Want to contribute?  There are many things you can do to help:
** Implement features (see Issues tab)
** Suggest new features
** Report or fix bugs
** Document code or features
** Add unit test cases
