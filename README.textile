* Dynamic and strong typing
* Everything is an (expando) object
* Prototypal inheritance
* First-class functions
* CLR interoperability
* Cross-platform (Windows, OSX, Linux)

h1. Installation

h2. 1. Mac OSX 

* Prerequisite: Mono 2.10.2 (I haven't tested with earlier versions)
* Download @bike.pkg@ in @installers/osx@
* Run @bike.pkg@ to install bike
* Open the Terminal and type the followings
<pre>@cat > hello.bk
println('Hello World');
Ctrl-D
bike.sh hello.bk@</pre>

bq. Notes:
If you didn't install Mono or bike to their default folders, modify @/usr/local/bin/bike.sh@
If you want to double-click to execute a bike file in Finder, associate the @.bk@ extension to @Applications/bike/bin/bike.app@

h2. 2. Windows

* Prerequisite: .NET 4.0
* Download @bike.exe@ in @installers/win@
* Run @bike.exe@ to extract and install bike
* Create a file named @hello.bk@ with this content <pre>@println('Hello World');@</pre>
* In the cmd, type @bike hello.bk@ to execute it. Alternatively, you can double-click a bike file in Windows Explorer.

bq. Notes:
The setup program also makes the following changes to your system:
@BIKE_HOME@ env variable pointing to the installation folder
Append @[installation_folder]bin/@ to @PATH@ env variable
Associate @.bk@ extension with @bike.exe@

h2. 3. Folder structure after installation

In OSX, bike is installed to @Applications/bike@. In Windows, bike is installed to @Program Files/bike@. The structure of the @bike@ folder is as follows:
* bin/: binaries and dependencies and
** bike.app (OSX only): the app you can used to associate with @.bk@ files so that they are executable via Finder
** bike.action (OSX only): the Automator action code used to create bike.app, feel free to customize
** bike.sh (OSX only): the shell script used to run bike (the same file also exists in @/usr/local/bin@)
* lib/
** src/
*** core/: Library source code
*** test/: Test for library
*** tools/: Bike doc and unit tools
*** doc/: API documentation
* samples/: Sample programs, most notable is @spec.bk@, an executable walkthrough to all language features
* resources/ (Windows only)
** np.xml: Syntax highlighting file for NotePad++ (in NotePad++, select View > User-Defined Dialog > Import)
* LICENSE
