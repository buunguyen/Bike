h1. Interpreted language built on .NET/Mono

* Dynamic and strong typing
* Everything is an (expando) object
* Prototypal inheritance
* First-class functions
* CLR interoperability
* Cross-platform (Windows, OSX, Linux)

h1. Run Bike

I don't update the Mac OSX and Windows installers frequently, except for major releases. So to access latest features, you should follow these steps: 

* Fork or download code
* Build (with @VS.NET@ or @MonoDevelop@, if you're on Mac OSX)
* If you use Windows, run <pre>@[code_folder]/src/Bike.Console/bin/Debug/bike.ex" -h="[code_folder]" bike_file.bk@</pre>
* If you use Mac OSX, run <pre>@/usr/bin/mono "[code_folder]/src/Bike.Console/bin/Debug/bike.exe" -h="[code_folder]" bike_file.bk@</pre>

bq. Notes:
- You should configure NotePad&#43;&#43;, TextMate or whatever code editor to run @bike@ based on the above commands
- NotePad++ users can use this "file":https://github.com/buunguyen/Bike/blob/master/resources/np.xml to enable syntax highlighting (View > User-Defined Dialog > Import)
- I will upload a TextMate bundle later

h1. Install Bike on Mac OSX

* Prerequisite: Mono 2.10.2 (not tested yet with earlier versions)
* Download @bike.pkg@ in @installers/osx@
* Run @bike.pkg@ to install Bike
* Open the Terminal and type the followings <pre>@cat > hello.bk
println('Hello World');
Ctrl-D
bike.sh hello.bk@</pre>

bq. Notes:
- If you didn't install Mono or Bike to their default folders, modify @/usr/local/bin/bike.sh@ to use correct paths
- If you want to double-click to execute a Bike file in @Finder@, associate the @.bk@ extension to @Applications/bike/bin/bike.app@


h1. Install Bike on Windows

* Prerequisite: .NET 4.0
* Download @bike.exe@ in @installers/win@
* Run @bike.exe@ to extract and install Bike
* Create a file named @hello.bk@ with this content <pre>@println('Hello World');@</pre>
* In the cmd, type @bike hello.bk@ to execute it. Alternatively, you can double-click a Bike file in Windows Explorer.

bq. The setup program also makes the following changes to your system:
- @BIKE_HOME@ env variable pointing to the installation folder
- Append @[installation_folder]bin/@ to @PATH@ env variable
- Associate @.bk@ extension with @bike.exe@


h1. Bike folder structure

In OSX, Bike is installed to @Applications/bike@. In Windows, Bike is installed to @Program Files/bike@. The structure of the Bike folder is as follows:
* @bin@: binaries and dependencies and
** @bike.app@ (OSX only): the app you can used to associate with @.bk@ files so that they are executable via Finder
** @bike.action@ (OSX only): the @Automator@ action code used to create @bike.app@, feel free to customize
** @bike.sh@ (OSX only): the shell script used to run Bike (the same file also exists in @/usr/local/bin@)
* @lib@
** @src@
*** @core@: Library source code
*** @test@: Test for library
*** @tools@: Bike doc and unit tools
** @doc@: API documentation
* @samples@: Sample programs, most notable is @spec.bk@
* @resources@ (Windows only)
** @np.xml@: Syntax highlighting file for NotePad++ (in NotePad++, select View > User-Defined Dialog > Import)
* @LICENSE@


h1. What's next?

* Want to learn more about Bike?  Take a look at sample code in "samples":https://github.com/buunguyen/Bike/tree/master/samples.  The file @spec.bk@ should give you a good overview.
* Want to contribute?  There are many things you can do to help:
** Implement features (see Issues tab)
** Suggest new features
** Report or fix bugs
** Document code or features
** Add unit test cases
