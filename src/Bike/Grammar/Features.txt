TODO
Resolution
- Use -paths (optional) for all paths
- If can't find core.bk in any search paths, use relative from bike.exe (../src/lib)
- -paths go to $PATHS, which is modified in bike
- When searching a file, search right-to-left parent to sub
- Need no env var
- Remove all location reference in DEBUG build (set -paths) and Test project (set $PATH explicitly)

Features
- Bitwise operator & |
- f(<TypeDesc>a, <TypeDesc>b);
	how about: f({'type': a, 'type': b})? -> seems good
	or using names: f({param_name: a})?
- throw vs throw e;
- Operator overloading (currently == for equals)
- load: should load into global frame?
	require
- Hosting API 
	Invoke BikeObject from .NET, wrapped in a DynamicObject? 
	Adjust Visibility of classes & members

Type system
- var so = System.Object; list<so> instead of list<System.Object>
- Interop with .NET collections: DONE -- to be tested 
- ref/out/nullable/optional parameters...
- Array marshalling: maintain values
- Nested classes
- Support structs

Optimization
- Parser, memoize?
- Tree optimization?
- Interpreter optimization?
- Tail call optimization
