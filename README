Bike programming language v1.0

Mac OSX
- Prerequisites: Mono 2.10.2 (I haven't tested with earlier versions)
- Download bike.pkg in runtime/osx
- Run bike.pkg to install bike
- Open the Terminal and type the followings
	- cat > hello.bk
	- println('Hello World');
	- Ctrl-D
	- bike.sh hello.bk
- Take a look at the section Folder Structure to know where the sample code is

Notes:
- If you didn't install Mono or bike to their default folders, modify /usr/local/bin/bike.sh
- If you want to double-click to execute a bike file in Finder, associate the .bk extension to Applications/bike/bin/bike.app

Windows
- Prerequisites: .NET 4.0
- Download bike.exe in runtime/win
- Run bike.exe to extract and install bike
- Create a file named hello.bk with this content println('Hello World')
- In the cmd, type bike hello.bk to execute it. Alternatively, you can double-click a bike file in Windows Explorer.

Notes:
- The setup program also makes the following changes to your system:
	- BIKE_HOME env variable pointing to the installation folder
	- Append [installation_folder]bin/ to PATH env variable
	- Associate .bk extension with bike.exe

Folder Structures
In OSX, bike is installed to Applications/bike.  In Windows, bike is installed to Program Files/bike.
The structure of the bike folder is as follows:
- bin/
	bike runtime and dependencies
	bike.app (OSX only)
	bike.action (OSX only): the Automator action used to create bike.app, feel free to customize
	bike.sh (OSX only): the shell script used to run bike (there's the same file in /usr/local/bin)
- lib/
	src/
		core/
			Library source code
		test/
			Test for library
		tools/
			Bike doc and unit tools
	doc/
		API documentation
- samples/
	Sample programs, most notable is spec.bk, an executable walkthrough to all language features
- resources/ (Windows only)
	np.xml: Syntax highlighting file for NotePad++ (in NP++, select View > User-Defined Dialog > Import)
- LICENSE
